TVO Installation

This is repeated in the README.otl file.

Extracting the archive

You will want to extract the distribution archive (.tar.gz or
.zip) into the installation directory described below. Make sure
that you use the directories in the file, because there are
several files with the same filename in different directories:

* MANIFEST
* README.otl
* doc/otl.txt
* plugin/filetype_otl.vim
* ftplugin/otl.vim
* syntax/otl.vim
* bitmaps/TVO/*.xpm    (under Unix)
* bitmaps/TVO/*.bmp    (under Windows or Mac)

Installing in a local or global .vim directory

You will want to install TVO into a directory in your Vim
runtimepath :he 'runtimepath'. Type the command

:set runtimepath

To find out what it is set to. This will display a list of
directories separated by commas. On my Linux system, these
directories are:

  ~/.vim
  /usr/local/share/vim/vimfiles
  /usr/local/share/vim/vim60
  /usr/local/share/vim/vimfiles/after
  ~/.vim/after

I installed TVO into my ~/.vim directory.

I could have also installed it so it would be available to all the
users on my system by putting it into either the
/usr/local/share/vim/vimfiles or /usr/local/share/vim/vim60
directories.

Installing the binaries

I've included some scripts in Perl and Ruby that I use for
conversion of .otl files to HTML, RTF, and Perl POD. There is also
a pod2otl converter.

You can move these to a directory on your path (you may also have
to change the shebang (#!) lines).

Installing the help file

TVO comes with a help file doc/otl.txt. See the Vim help:

  :he add-local-help.

After you've put this help file into a 'doc' directory under one
of the directories on your 'runtimepath', use :he :helptags:

  :helptags ~/.vim/doc

(substitute the name of the directory where you put the otl.txt
file).

Now you can use the help to find out more about tvo.

  :he tvo

My .vimrc settings

	" defaults:
	let otl_install_menu=1
	let no_otl_maps=0
	let no_otl_insert_maps=0

	" overrides:
	let otl_bold_headers=0
	let otl_use_thlnk=0

	" au BufWinLeave *.otl mkview
	" au BufWinEnter *.otl silent loadview
	let maplocalleader = ","


Overriding TVO settings

You can make changes to the way that TVO starts up by making a file called
after/ftplugin/otl.vim under your ~/.vim directory (see above about runtimepath)
(on my system it would be called ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/otl.vim).

For instance, if you want to make it so that you open outlines showing only the
first level, you could put in that file

	set foldlevel=0
