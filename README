TVO (The Vim Outliner) is my solution for text outlining in Vim.

It works a lot like Word's outline support, but is much more vim-compatible.
It has syntax highlighting, embedded text blocks, shortcut mappings using both  LocalLeader and arrow keys, and works reasonably well with Vim Easy.
There is a toolbar that will be familiar to you if you've used Word's outliner.

You can extract just text, or just headings if you wish; there's also some converters (to HTML, Perl POD, and to RTF) included.

Please email me with bug reports, improvements, comments or more documentation (badly needed!).
